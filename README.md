Book and Author Management API
 This project implements a RESTful API for managing books and authors. The API is built using Node.js and includes features such as pagination, error handling, email verification, and data validation.

Features:
 Pagination:
  Implemented pagination for GET endpoints to retrieve all books and authors efficiently. Users can navigate through large datasets by requesting specific pages, improving performance and usability.

 Error Handling:
  Robust error handling is implemented across all endpoints to ensure proper response to invalid inputs, missing resources, and server errors. This includes custom error messages and appropriate HTTP status codes.

 Email Verification:
  Integrated email verification to ensure that users' email addresses are valid. This feature sends a verification email upon user registration and requires the user to verify their email before accessing certain functionalities.

 Data Validation:
  All incoming requests are validated to ensure data integrity. This includes checking for required fields, proper data formats, and constraints (e.g., valid email format, unique author names, etc.).

Tech Stack:
 Back-end: Node.js
 Database: MongoDB
 
Installation:
1.Clone the repository.
2.Run npm install to install dependencies.
3.Set up environment variables for the database connection and email service.
4.Run npm start to start the server.

Usage:
 Use tools like Postman to interact with the API.
 The API supports CRUD operations for both books and authors, with additional features like pagination, validation, and email verification.
 
Future Enhancements:
 Add support for search functionality.
 Implement user authentication and authorization.
 Extend email notifications for other user actions.
